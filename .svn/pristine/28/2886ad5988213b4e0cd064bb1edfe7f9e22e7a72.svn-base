==================================
oscFit's documentation
==================================

*Fitting atmospheric neutrino oscillations since 2012!*

Using the documentation
=======================

The oscFit project is large, and can be overwhelming for new users. That's why the documentation follows a style in which, for each topic, you have:

* An introductory paragraph

* Essentials: A set of simple instructions or a tutorial to get you started

* Advanced: An in-depth explanation of what oscFit does and why so

First time users might want to quickly glance over the first two items. Advanced users and developers are encouraged to have a close look at the in-depth explanations.
