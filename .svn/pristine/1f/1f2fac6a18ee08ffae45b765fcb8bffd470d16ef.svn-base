oscFit 3D 2.0
Release Notes
==============

Changes vs oscFitND v1.1


Major changes
-------------

- Not ND anymore. Users can define up to 3 dimensions. Need more? Fire up another dataLoader.
- Correction for the MC expectation of the baseline is always applied.
- Detection systematics are calculated from/applied to atmospheric muons.
- Detector systematics are calculated/applied *per flavor/interaction*. Always.
- File to help users of previous versions to move to the newer version.


Minor changes
-------------

- Histograms of systematic variations are stored after first calculation. Faster code.
- Arbitrary detector systematics can be defined in dataLoader for testing.
- Python minimizers play nice with the code. Recommendation: SLSQP. Fast and reliable.
- Default values stored in a different module. User can override any of them without changing the file.
- The Barlow likelihood has been debugged; works out of the box.
- Users are encouraged to KDE the systematic uncertainties. Only needed once if settings do not change.


Upcoming changes (next version)
-------------------------------
- Calculate oscillations, flux changes in finely binned tables. Use that instead of event-wise changes.
- Allow NuTau NC normalization. Trivial, but requires some thinkering with the code.
